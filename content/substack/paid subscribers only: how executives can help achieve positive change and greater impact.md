*Hi everyone,*

*Thank you for reading Great CTOs Focus on Outcomes. I publish weekly and have an archive of over 150 posts, each packed with valuable insights on various topics relevant to CTOs and the issues they face, distilled from my career experience.*

*I strive to make each post a helpful resource on the topic it focuses on so that when a CTO has a need, they can reference an atomic nugget of insight. To this end, I regularly revisit and refine posts, ensuring you always receive the best and most up-to-date information with the most clarity.*

```
If you’d like to support the growth of this resource, consider upgrading to paid and take advantage of the other ways I can help you.
```

**There are always more opportunities to improve the effectiveness of an organisation. You are never done with this work. It's easy to get too busy or feel the change involved with some of these opportunities is too complicated, and when there’s an opportunity to grow through hiring, some of these may stay on the back burner.**

If that option is limited or cannot be used sparingly, you must look elsewhere for a more productive capacity. This will lead you to examine where you can improve within your existing workforce.

From our survey of opportunities in my [previous post on amplifying software engineering impact](https://hyprinnovation.io/our-thoughts/when-budgets-are-tight-a-leader-s-guide-to-amplifying-software-product-engineering-impact), we can summarise the following strategies we identified, which can be applied to help us reduce wasted effort and increase our impact:

* **See inflight work through to completion**
* **Identify what to subtract**
* **Tackle the riskiest assumptions first**
* **Identify organisational constraints differently**
* **Establish new ways to determine progress**
* **Better time and meeting management**
* **Improve decision-making throughout the organisation**
* **Identify and invest in learning opportunities**
* **Systematise bringing in new organisational changes**
* **Prioritise problems the organisation is experiencing**

Let’s explore how each can help us and what might be involved in bringing this change to reality.
