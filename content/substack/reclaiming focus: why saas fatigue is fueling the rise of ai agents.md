*Hi everyone,*

*Thank you for reading Great CTO. I publish weekly and have an archive of over 150 posts, each packed with valuable insights on various topics relevant to the CTO and the issues they face, distilled from my career experience.*

*I strive to make each post a helpful resource on the topic it focuses on so that when a CTO has a need, they can reference an atomic nugget of insight. To this end, I regularly revisit and refine posts, ensuring you always receive the best and most up-to-date information with the most clarity.*

*This is an AI-assisted post based on brainstorming I did with one of my chatbots. It is more intended as a thought starter. Nonetheless, it raises some interesting questions about whether the AI investment bubble will disrupt SaaS businesses.*  
If you‚Äôve ever caught yourself juggling tabs like a circus act‚ÄîCRM open in one, docs in another, code tools spread across monitors‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. Today‚Äôs tech leaders operate in increasingly fragmented environments, where every function demands its own SaaS platform. We‚Äôve added tools to gain efficiency, but in the process, we‚Äôve lost something more valuable: our focus.

Now the cracks are showing. And AI agents might be the wedge driving the next wave of disruption.

## The Hidden Cost of SaaS Sprawl

Narrowly focused SaaS tools do one thing well‚Äîand that‚Äôs precisely the problem. The more comprehensive your needs, the more tools you end up stitching together. For consultants like me, multiply that by every client relationship, resulting in a chaotic web of logins, interfaces, and subscriptions.

The time cost is real:

* Authenticating into dozens of tools.
* Managing credentials across clients.
* Adapting to inconsistent UIs and workflows.
* Constantly context-switching to perform basic actions.

Then there‚Äôs the pricing model. Per-seat subscriptions and bloated tiers often don‚Äôt reflect the value you extract. You pay full price, whether in the app all day or need it for one key function.

These inefficiencies aren‚Äôt just annoying‚Äîthey‚Äôre structural. And that‚Äôs what makes SaaS ripe for disruption.

## AI Agents as the New Interface Layer

Smart money is moving toward AI, not just because it‚Äôs shiny and new, but because it targets this inefficiency head-on. AI agents, like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or orchestrators like n8n and Zapier, are increasingly replacing the need to live inside every SaaS interface.

Sure, the integrations are still fiddly. You‚Äôll spend some time up front setting up API keys or designing workflows. However, once configured, the payoff is significant.

I now spend far less time inside individual tools and far more time in front of intelligent orchestrators. I can pull client data, summarise documents, draft replies, and update systems‚Äîwithout touching half the SaaS platforms on which those actions depend.

That‚Äôs not just streamlining. That‚Äôs reclaiming agency.

## For Tech Leaders, This Isn‚Äôt Optional

If you lead a team‚Äîor serve multiple clients‚Äîyou‚Äôre likely feeling this friction already. The question isn‚Äôt if AI will change how you work. It‚Äôs how intentionally you‚Äôll adopt it before it becomes standard.

With orchestration tools and AI automation:

* You reduce authentication fatigue.
* You escape per-seat pricing traps by minimising direct usage.
* You adapt workflows to your rhythm, not the other way around.
* You unlock insights across tools, without needing to check each manually.

It‚Äôs not about replacing SaaS‚Äîit‚Äôs about decoupling the function from the interface.

## So, Where Do You Start?

Here‚Äôs a pragmatic path to get going:

1. **Audit your toolset:** Where do you spend time managing the tool, rather than using it?
2. **Pick a high-friction workflow:** What feels like ‚Äútoo many steps‚Äù every time you do it?
3. **Design a lightweight solution:** Use Claude, GPT, Zapier, or n8n to test an AI-driven interaction layer.
4. **Iterate toward utility:** Don‚Äôt automate everything‚Äîjust the things interrupting your focus.

**Over to You**

Are AI agents a curiosity for your team, or are you already building your orchestration layer? What‚Äôs been your biggest blocker‚Äîtechnical, budget, or mindset?

**Q1:** What SaaS platform do you wish to use *without* logging in?

**Q2:** How much time are you losing to tool-switching and authentication across your week?

**Q3:** How different would your stack look if you could price SaaS based on actual value delivered?

Let‚Äôs talk. The SaaS stack is bloated, the interfaces are clunky, and the margins are wide. That‚Äôs not a recipe for sustainability‚Äîit‚Äôs a sign of coming change.

## **üëÄ Coming Soon‚Ä¶**

Next week, I‚Äôll continue my theme of AI-assisted development, covering all angles important for technology leaders to make informed decisions on leveraging this fast-evolving technology and what it means for other decisions, such as hiring and budgeting.
