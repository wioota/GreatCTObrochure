*Hi everyone,*

*Thank you for reading Great CTO. I publish weekly and have an archive of over 150 posts, each packed with valuable insights on various topics relevant to the CTO and the issues they face, distilled from my career experience.*

*I strive to make each post a helpful resource on the topic it focuses on so that when a CTO has a need, they can reference an atomic nugget of insight. To this end, I regularly revisit and refine posts, ensuring you always receive the best and most up-to-date information with the most clarity.*

*This is an AI-assisted post based on brainstorming I did with one of my chatbots. It is intended as a thought starter on key issues CTOs are experiencing.*

# **Introduction - CTOs Should ‚ÄòGet Off The Tools‚Äô, Right?!**

One of the most repeated pieces of advice CTO coaches give is, *‚ÄúGet off the tools.‚Äù* Focus on vision, people, and scale. Let the team code‚Äîyour job is to lead.

Like any context-free advice, it‚Äôs good advice until it *isn‚Äôt*.

In a world where AI-assisted development redefines the relationship between humans and code, it‚Äôs time to revisit that assumption. What if *staying close to the tools* isn‚Äôt a sign of poor delegation, but a competitive advantage, when done with strategic intent?  
  
\* I can hear a gasp from 1000 CTO Coaches as they read this line \*

# **The Classic Rationale for Stepping Back**

CTOs are told to step back from hands-on coding for good reason. As teams grow, the demands on leadership shift. Your leverage comes not from the lines of code you write, but from the systems you architect‚Äîtechnical, operational, and cultural.

Writing code when you should be scaling culture is often a sign of avoidance or over-comfort. And when you're the bottleneck for decisions or pull requests, that‚Äôs a problem.

But the game has changed.

# **AI Tools Have Shifted the Leverage Point**

The emergence of tools like **Cline**, **Cursor**, **RooCode**, and **Windsurf** is not just about productivity. It‚Äôs about cognition. These platforms act less like IDEs and more like *thinking companions*‚Äîcollaborators that reason, suggest, and refactor alongside you. The working practices for individuals and teams shift, and all of a sudden, there are a lot of new concepts to learn, and they continue to evolve quickly.

Understanding how to¬†*ask*¬†and¬†*guide*¬†AI becomes as crucial as writing code in this new paradigm. That shift creates a new strategic surface for the CTO.

## **Three Strategic Reasons to Stay (Selectively) ‚ÄúOn the Tools‚Äù**

1. **Pattern Recognition at the Frontier**  
   When you're building in a fast-moving domain (e.g., LLM integration, agent workflows, multi-modal AI apps), your team is likely learning on the job. Being hands-on‚Äîeven briefly‚Äîgives you context to spot emerging abstractions, brittle edge cases, or systemic inefficiencies early.

This isn't micromanagement. It's proximity to the edge of innovation. With some large shifts, such as the changes involved with AI-assisted development, it‚Äôs common to find some of your team's experienced members behind the curve. That makes it hard to delegate leading such a shift to them.

2. **Empathy and Enablement**  
   Many AI development workflows still have rough edges. Prompt strategies, tool ergonomics, integration quirks‚Äîthese are lived experiences your team wrestles with daily. When you occasionally pair-program with AI or explore a new tool firsthand, you gain insight into where your developers are getting stuck, bored, or confused.

That knowledge enables better process design, onboarding, and toolchain selection. Most importantly, it helps you better understand what is involved in the change so you can lead it more effectively and know the team‚Äôs concerns firsthand.

3. **Credibility and Thought Leadership**  
   If you‚Äôre a product-led CTO in an AI-driven business, your credibility doesn‚Äôt just come from title‚Äîit comes from demonstrated understanding. Investors, customers, and candidates want to know: *Does this leader understand the terrain they‚Äôre navigating?*

You don‚Äôt need to be the best engineer in the room. But if you‚Äôve explored the tools, you‚Äôll speak with authority, grounded in experience, not hearsay. You won‚Äôt be driving your team into unsafe situations where the hype doesn‚Äôt match the reality.

## **All Technical Leadership is Situational**

This doesn‚Äôt mean reverting to being the lead engineer. It means selectively engaging in hands-on work when it supports broader strategic goals:

* **To validate a new AI-assisted development workflow before rolling it out team-wide**
* **To prototype and test ideas at the edge of what‚Äôs possible**
* **To evaluate tools with a practitioner‚Äôs mindset, not just a buyer‚Äôs**

CTOs who embrace this model aren't doing it to control. They‚Äôre doing it to *sense*, *learn*, and *guide*.

More on why doing real work with these tools is required to assess and understand them here properly:

# **Closing Thought**

Being ‚Äúon the tools‚Äù isn‚Äôt a binary choice‚Äîit‚Äôs a dial you adjust based on context. AI-assisted development gives CTOs a new kind of leverage: faster learning cycles, deeper insight into team pain points, and a sharper lens for strategic opportunities.  
  
The larger the organisation, the more likely it is that you have people more than capable of delegating this to and other priorities that might outrank this one. But that isn‚Äôt all companies. Navigating this shift might be your top priority if you compete based on speed or technical capability.

So next time someone tells you to ‚Äúget off the tools,‚Äù pause and ask: *Is there a strategic reason for me doing this, and have I adequately communicated my intent?*
