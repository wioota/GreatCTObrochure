# Fractional CTO: Senior Technology Leadership When You Need It

Get the strategic technology leadership your growing company needs without the full-time executive cost. Perfect for companies scaling from startup to scale-up.

## The Challenge

Your company is growing fast, but you're at an inflection point:

- **Technical complexity** is outpacing your current team's capabilities
- **Strategic decisions** need senior technology leadership input
- **Engineering team** needs direction and mentorship to scale
- **Technology roadmap** requires alignment with business objectives
- **Full-time CTO** is either not in budget or not yet justified

You need senior technology leadership now, but a full-time CTO hire might be:
- **Too expensive** for your current stage and budget
- **Too risky** if you're not sure what type of CTO you need
- **Too slow** given urgent technology decisions and challenges
