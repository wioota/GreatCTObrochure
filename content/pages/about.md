# About Daniel Walters

I'm Daniel Walters, an experienced CTO and CTO Coach dedicated to helping technology leaders thrive in an ever-evolving landscape.

## My Mission

**Helping CTOs be more helpful leaders by giving teams the context they need to do their best work.**

Through Great CTO, I provide practical advice and proven practices from my experience as both a practicing CTO and coach. My focus is on outcomes—cutting through hype to deliver actionable insights that make a real difference.

## Background

As an experienced CTO and CTO Coach, I've navigated the challenges of scaling technology organizations, leading through uncertainty, and adapting to rapid technological change—especially the transformative impact of AI on software development.

My approach combines:
- **Practical Experience**: Real-world insights from building and leading technology teams
- **Coaching Expertise**: Proven frameworks for developing leadership capabilities
- **Current Relevance**: Deep understanding of how AI is reshaping the CTO role

## What I Do

### Group CTO Coaching
I facilitate collaborative coaching sessions where CTOs share experiences, learn from peers, and tackle real challenges together. This peer-to-peer approach creates powerful learning opportunities.

### CTO Life Line
Monthly livestream conversations where we discuss current challenges, explore AI's impact on technology leadership, and share practical strategies for navigating change.

### Community Building
Through our Discord community and curated resources like the CTO Coach Directory, I help CTOs connect, learn, and grow together.

### Content & Insights
I regularly write about the intersection of technology leadership, AI-assisted development, and organizational effectiveness, focusing on practical application over theoretical concepts.

## Key Focus Areas

### AI-Assisted Development
As AI reshapes how we build software, I help CTOs understand:
- When and how to adopt AI tools effectively
- The changing role of engineering teams
- Balancing automation with human expertise
- Strategic implications for technology organizations

### Outcome-Oriented Leadership
I believe in focusing on results that matter:
- Helping teams understand the "why" behind their work
- Creating context that enables better decision-making
- Measuring what actually drives business value
- Building cultures of continuous improvement

### Practical Application
Theory without practice is just speculation. I emphasize:
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Actionable frameworks and tools
- Learning from both successes and failures
- Adapting proven practices to your unique context

## My Philosophy

**Stop pretending your code is a Stradivarius.** Technology is a tool for creating value, not an end in itself. The best CTOs understand that excellence comes from empowering teams to do their best work, not from perfectionism for its own sake.

In the age of AI-assisted development, this perspective is more important than ever. We must focus on outcomes while embracing the tools that help us achieve them more effectively.
